## **Description**
Using multiple API calls this application will assist the user in finding schools that they are interested in by either searching for a specific city or by searching using keywords from the school itself. 

Once the user makes a search they will be shown a list of either all of the schools in the city they searched or any school matching the keywords that they used if searching for schools specifically. The list that is generated will have good base information for each school shown. The logo, tuition cost, completion rate and a link to the school's website will be readily available to the user while scrolling through the list. 

When the user selects a school they will be shown more detailed information about that school and will also be shown a quality of life table for the city that school is in. If the city does not have quality of life information available, the user will be notified of this with an on-screen message.
